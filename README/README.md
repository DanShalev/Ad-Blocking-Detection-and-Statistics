# Ad Blocking Detection & Statistics

This project is intended to be used as an ad blocking detection and statistics system.
This is basically a website that store information and statistics on ads. Given a specific ad in a web page, statistics about the ad is gathered, including amount of page entrance in which the ad was blocked.

IDEA: 
Basically, this is a user-based website. Each user is given a script that should be included in the web page that contains the ad on which the user would like to gather data and statistics. The script detects when an ad is blocked, and update a remote server with the relevant data. Then, all data related to a user or a specific ad is gathered in the system, and is accessible throw a user-friendly interface in the website, including raw data and statistics graphs and charts.

Implementation:
The system is built as a website.
This site uses PHP to handle the server side, SQL database to save user data.
The front end is implemented by HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. Also includes BOOTSTRAP elements for better site scalability.
NOTE: Part of the site graphics, and mainly the charts and graphs are  included in a licensed theme called bucket, and were not implemented by the author.

EXAMPLE PICTURES:
Early stage pictures (that can give an idea to the site look) can be found in directory "README/EXAMPLE PICTURES".
